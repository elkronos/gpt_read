# gpt_read: A Document Question Answering System

This repository contains a system that allows users to ask questions of documents and receive answers generated by GPT models. It supports various document formats and implements several methods for retrieving relevant information.

## Overview

The system includes different methods to process and analyze documents:

- **Retrieval Mode:** Extracts relevant text using keyword-based filtering.
- **Chunked Mode:** Splits the document into smaller chunks and queries each one separately.
- **Semantic Mode:** Sorts text chunks by semantic relevance before querying.
- **Hierarchical Mode:** Summarizes text chunks first and then uses the summaries to answer the question.
- **MultiPass Mode:** Combines both retrieval and chunked methods to generate a final answer.

## Aims

- **Time Saving:** Automates the extraction of key information, reducing the need to manually search through documents.
- **Flexibility:** Offers multiple methods that can be chosen based on the document type and question complexity.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Allows comparison of different approaches to determine the most effective method.
- **Wide Compatibility:** Supports a range of document formats including PDF, DOCX, TXT, and images (with OCR).

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Document:**  
   Place your document in the appropriate folder. Supported formats include PDF, DOCX, TXT, and images (using OCR).

2. **Select a Retrieval Method:**  
   Choose one of the available methods (Retrieval, Chunked, Semantic, Hierarchical, or MultiPass) based on your document and question.

3. **Ask a Question:**  
   Use the provided functions to submit your question. The system processes the document using the selected method and returns an answer.

4. **Review and Compare:**  
   Experiment with different methods and settings to find the most suitable approach for your needs.

This project attempts to offer a clear and systematic way to analyze documents and extract relevant information using multiple processing techniques.
